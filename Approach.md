# SecurFlow CI/CD Framework

## 1. Pre-Commit (Developer's Workspace)

- **Pre-commit hooks**: Use tools like Husky to enforce rules before a commit is made. Include linters, formatters, organization rules, and more.

- **Detect Secrets**: Use tools such as git-secrets, gitleaks, and credscan to scan for plain text secrets in your code as part of the pre-commit hooks.
- **MFA & Zero Trust**: Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and Zero Trust principles in the developer's environment.
- **IaC Testing**: Test Infrastructure as Code (IaC) configurations with tools such as Terratest, rspec, Chef InSpec, or ServerSpec.

## 2. Source Code Management (SCM)

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Implement RBAC on your SCM to ensure that only authorized users can access and make changes to your code.
- **Enforce Access Policy Controls**: Configure your SCM to enforce necessary access policy controls.
- **Branch Protection Rules**: Enforce branch protection rules on your SCM to prevent force pushes, require status checks before merging pull requests, and ensure commits are signed.

## 3. Post-Commit and PR Time (Integration Time)

- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Use a CI server to automatically build and test your code every time changes are pushed. 
- **Software Composition Analysis (SCA)**: Use tools such as Snyk or WhiteSource to analyze your project's dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
- **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)**: Use tools like SonarQube or Fortify to perform static analysis of your code.
- **Integrated Application Security Testing (IAST)**: Include an IAST tool to provide real-time vulnerability assessment.
- **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)**: Use DAST tools to identify vulnerabilities in your running application.
- **Fuzz Testing**: Include fuzz testing tools to perform randomized testing and identify previously unknown security vulnerabilities.
- **API Testing**: Use tools like Postman to test your API endpoints.
- **Compliance Checks**: Use tools such as Chef InSpec or OpenSCAP to check for compliance with relevant standards.
- **SBOM Generation**: Generate a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) as part of your build process.

## 4. Post-PR (Delivery/Deployment Time)

- **Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD)**: Automate your deployments to a staging or production environment.
- **IaC & Configuration Management**: Use tools like Terraform, Chef, or Puppet to manage your infrastructure and its configuration.
- **SLSA Compliance**: Ensure that the pipeline follows the principles of SLSA.
- **The Update Framework (TUF)**: Implement The Update Framework to secure your software update system.

## 5. Post-Deployment (Runtime Time)

- **Monitoring & Alerting**: Use tools like Grafana, Prometheus, or Google Cloud Operations to monitor your application and alert you of any issues.
- **Security Checks**: Continually scan your live application for vulnerabilities.
